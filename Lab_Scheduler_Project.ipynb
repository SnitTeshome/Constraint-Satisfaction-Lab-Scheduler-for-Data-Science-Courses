    "This project presents a *Constraint Satisfaction Lab Scheduler* that was developed to automatically generate valid weekly timetables for *Data Science and Analytics courses* at *USIU-Africa*  courses categorized as STA, DSA, MTH, APT, and IST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the system was created to assign over *40 courses*, some of which have multiple sections, bringing the total number of classes to *65, to 5 laboratory rooms* located in the *Lillian K. Beam Building*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further flexibility and usability, the system was later enhanced to accept *custom user input, allowing any number of **data science courses, **labs, and **lecturers* to be defined. This enhancement was introduced to accommodate the dynamic nature of teaching staff, fluctuating course loads across different semesters, and to make the system adaptable for scheduling in *other campus buildings beyond Lillian K. Beam*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler was designed with the following core objectives:\n",
    "- Each course section must be assigned a valid *day, **time slot, **lab, and **lecturer*.\n",
    "- *No two course sections* should share the same lab or lecturer at the same time.\n",
    "- *Double-session classes* must be consistently scheduled on either *Monday/Wednesday* or *Tuesday/Thursday*.\n",
    "- *Full-session classes* must be scheduled on *Friday or Saturday* only.\n",
    "- *Back-to-back teaching blocks* for lecturers must be minimized to avoid overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve these goals, the following input is processed:\n",
    "- A list of approximately *65 course sections*\n",
    "- Pools of lecturers grouped by *department code* (e.g., DSA, MTH, APT)\n",
    "- Available *days* (Monday to Saturday) and *time slots*\n",
    "- A list of available *laboratory rooms*\n",
    "\n",
    "From this input, a *domain of possible assignments* is constructed for each course — consisting of all valid combinations of *(day, time slot, lab, lecturer)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of constraint functions is applied to ensure a feasible schedule:\n",
    "- room_conflict() — avoids assigning two classes to the same lab at the same time.\n",
    "- lecturer_conflict() — prevents instructors from being double-booked.\n",
    "- same_course_consistency() — ensures consistent day-pairing for each course.\n",
    "- back_to_back_ok() — avoids assigning too many consecutive sessions to lecturers.\n",
    "- paired_day_of() — maps sessions to valid day pairs (e.g., Monday → Wednesday).\n",
    "\n",
    "A *backtracking algorithm* is used as the core solver. It recursively assigns courses to valid slots while checking for constraint violations. If a violation is detected, the algorithm *backtracks* and tries alternate assignments, continuing until a complete and valid schedule is found — or it confirms that no valid arrangement is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Why Backtracking?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking was chosen because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can efficiently search large solution spaces.SPACE AND TIME COMPLEITY\n",
    "* It handles complex, interdependent constraints.\n",
    "* It guarantees either a valid full solution or proof that no such schedule exists.\n",

    "- Assigned *days*\n",
    "- *Time slots*\n",
    "- *Laboratory rooms*\n",
    "- *Lecturers*\n",
    "\n",
    "This scheduling system demonstrates how constraint satisfaction techniques, combined with backtracking, can be effectively used to solve complex, real-world timetable generation problems — with scalability and adaptability in mind.\n",

    "\n",

    "   It selects the next session to work on from the pre-determined order list.\n",

    "   * **Room Conflict:** Ensure the room isn't double-booked.\n",
    "   * **Lecturer Conflict:** Ensure a lecturer isn’t double-booked.\n",

    "               - The room and lecturer schedules are updated to reflect the new booking.\n",

    "   * Reverts room and lecturer schedules.\n",
    "   * Update all sets (restore previous state)\n",

    "   If no option works, it concludes that no solution exists for the current path and backs up further."

    "The  backtracking algorithm is designed to **fill schedules based on the order of available time slots**, while strictly respecting all given constraints — including **day and time availability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Friday and Saturday are provided as valid days in the input, they may not appear in the final schedule because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The algorithm starts filling from the earliest available slots** (typically Monday and Tuesday).\n",
    "* If all course and lab sessions are successfully assigned within those earlier days, **there’s no need for the algorithm to continue filling the rest of the week**.\n",
    "* As a result, **Friday and Saturday remain unused**, not because they are invalid, but because the algorithm already found a complete, conflict-free schedule earlier in the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is intentional and efficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It **minimizes scheduling complexity** by avoiding unnecessary spreading across days.\n",
    "* It **respects the principle of compact timetabling**, which is desirable in small-class scenarios where early-week availability is enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In  general  the algorithm doesn’t ignore Friday and Saturday — it simply doesn’t need them, because the required sessions fit neatly into earlier slots like Monday and Tuesday.\n"
